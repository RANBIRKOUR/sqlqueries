A SQL CASE statement evaluates and returns results based on particular values, predicates and conditions as per defined logic.


SYNTAX:

CASE expression

   WHEN value_1 THEN result_1
   WHEN value_2 THEN result_2
   ...
   WHEN value_n THEN result_n

   ELSE result

END
--------------------------
Every CASE statement must end with the END statement. The ELSE statement is optional, and provides a way to capture values not specified in the WHEN/THEN statements. CASE is easiest to understand in the context of an example:

EXAMPLE:

DATABASE: AdventureWorks2014

TABLE: Sales.SalesOrderHeader

Find out how many sales in Sales.SalesOrderHeader fell into the following ranges: 

“$0 to $149.99”,

 “$150 – 499.99”,

 “$500 to $4,999.99”, 

“$5,000 - $24,999.99”, and “Over $25,000”.

 Only analyze sales that had a sales person associated with them.


QUERY:

WITH SalesRanges 
AS (
 SELECT 
 CASE 
  WHEN TotalDue BETWEEN 0 AND 149.99
    THEN '$0 to $149.99' 
  WHEN TotalDue BETWEEN 150 AND 499.99 
    THEN '$150 to $499.99' 
  WHEN TotalDue BETWEEN 500 AND 4999.99 
    THEN '$500 to $4,999.99'
  WHEN TotalDue BETWEEN 5000 AND 24999.99
    THEN '$5,000 to $24,999.99'
  ELSE 'Over $25,000'
    END AS SalesPriceRange,
           SalesOrderID 
  FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader 
    WHERE SalesPersonID IS NOT NULL
   ) 
    SELECT SalesPriceRange,
           COUNT(*)
    FROM SalesRanges
    GROUP BY SalesPriceRange
